    - This test, as described in the original paper, is recovering a known potential to show that the methodology works. The target data was derived from LJ fluids at three different states.

    - This test, as described in the original 2014 paper, performs further optimizations on propane using a coarse-graining 3-1 mapping. The 3-site propane is mapped to the single-site propane and the generated data can be compared to known LJ potentials from literature [1].
